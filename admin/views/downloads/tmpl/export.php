<h3>How to open a CSV file</h3>

<p>A comma-separated values (CSV) file is any file containing text that is separated with a comma, but can also be a file separated with any other character. A CSV file can be opened in any program, however, for most users, a CSV file is best viewed through a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc or Google Docs.</p>

<h4>Microsoft Excel</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><p>If Microsoft Excel has been installed on the computer, by default CSV files should open automatically in Excel when the file is double-clicked. If you are getting an Open With prompt when opening the CSV file, choose Microsoft Excel from the available programs to open the file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Alternatively, you can open Microsoft Excel and in the menu bar, select File, Open, and select the .CSV file.</p></li>
  <li><p>If after opening the CSV file, the text is all in a single column (instead of being separated at each comma into individual columns), open the file in Microsoft Excel. Use the Text Import Wizard, which will prompt you to specify how you want the text separated. Choose the Delimited option, then on the next screen, choose the Comma option. This should result in the text being separated at each comma and being placed in individual columns.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Google Docs</h4>
<p>Open Google Docs, click the Upload icon Google Docs Upload icon, select Files, and browse to the directory containing the .CSV file and select it. If an Upload settings window appears, check the box for Convert documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and drawings to the corresponding Google Docs format and click Start Upload.</p>
